I am an open-source engineer, a full-stack developer with extensive experience in web and mobile, a blockchain engineer, lead author of the 0xcert Protocol, co-author of ERC-2477 standard, co-author of the reference implementation of the ERC-721 non-fungible token standard, CTO veteran, startup mentor, web designer, and musician. I started my career back in 1996, and worked on numerous exciting projects for domestic and foreign startups, corporations, and government institutions.

Open source is my passion. My focus is now mostly on the development of decentralized technologies and research in lower-level protocols.
