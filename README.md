I am an open-source engineer, a full-stack developer with extensive experience in web and mobile development, a blockchain engineer, lead author of the 0xcert Protocol, co-author of EIP-2477 standard, CTO veteran, startup mentor, web designer, and musician. I started my career in 1996, and have worked on numerous exciting projects for domestic and foreign startups, corporations, and government institutions.

Open source has always been an integral part of my work and is lately becoming even more prominent in my work and life. I contribute mostly to TypeScript, NodeJS, and Rust projects. My code is clean, well documented, performant, scalable, and long-term sustainable.
